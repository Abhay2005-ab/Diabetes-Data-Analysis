# Diabetes Data Analysis | Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
## Project Summary

This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a diabetes dataset to identify key health indicators influencing diabetes diagnosis.
The analysis focuses on data cleaning, statistical insights, and meaningful visualizations to support data-driven decision-making in healthcare.

## Skills Demonstrated

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Data Visualization

Statistical Analysis

Healthcare Data Interpretation

## Tech Stack

Programming Language: Python

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Environment: Jupyter Notebook

## Dataset Information

Dataset: Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset

Records include medical attributes such as:

Glucose

BMI

Insulin

Blood Pressure

Age

Outcome (Diabetic / Non-Diabetic)

## Analysis Workflow

Imported and inspected dataset

Handled missing and zero-value entries

Generated statistical summaries

Performed univariate & bivariate analysis

Visualized correlations using heatmaps and boxplots

Compared features based on diabetes outcome

## Key Findings

Glucose level is the strongest indicator of diabetes

Higher BMI and age increase diabetes risk

Several medical features contain zero values indicating data quality issues

Clear feature correlation patterns observed via heatmap
